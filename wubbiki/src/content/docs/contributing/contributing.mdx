**Anyone** can contribute to this wiki! You can help us make pages, or edit existing pages.

## Contributing to the Wiki
To contribute to this wiki, you must be familiar with:
- Markdown, it is what all page's content uses.
- Git, to contribute to the wiki repo.
- VSCode, to edit the files. (you can use other editors aswell)

All of the pages are stored in a [github repo](https://github.com/yourlocalonion/wubbiki).

Wubbiki uses **markdown**, specifically **MarkdownX**. The syntax is similar to markdown, but 
since Wubbiki was built off of **Astro's [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)** template, 
you can use Starlight's [components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/).

Here is this page in code-form:

<Code code={importedCode} lang="mdx" title={'contributing.mdx'}/>

You can edit a page by clicking the "Edit page" text at the bottom of every page, This will
take you to the file in the github repo.
