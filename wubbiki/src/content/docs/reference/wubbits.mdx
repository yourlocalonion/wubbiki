## Earning Wubbits

There are multiple ways to earn wubbits:
- Buying wubbits using robux in the hub shop,
or
- Earning wubbits from your world.

Earning wubbits in your world is simple, if there are players in your world or you're simply just
building in your world, you periodically get wubbits. How many wubbits you get is increased if
there are more players in your world.

<Aside type='danger' title='Warning'>
AFKing with your alts or by yourself in a world is called *Wubbit farming.*

**This is highly prohibited and is bannable!**

You can also earn wubbits by playing the game everyday, there is a daily streak everytime you play.\
If you continue your streak, you earn more wubbits everyday.\
If you break your streak, you go back to the lowest earning.
