Worlds are the little enterable "games" in wubby.\
Each world contain blocks, wiring *(more about that later on!)* etc. 

To create world you must:

<Steps>

1. Head to the "My Profile" tab, then click "New World".\
   **Note: After 50 worlds, you must pay 300 wubbits to create a world.**

2. After confirming, Input your world name and then choose a template.\
   In this guide, we will be using the "Canvas" template. (you can choose any template though!) 

3. Click (or tap) the "Done button".

</Steps>

Congratulations! You've made your first world! (or another number if you've already made worlds).\
To configure worlds, head to the next page.
