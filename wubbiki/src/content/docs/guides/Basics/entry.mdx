Wubby wiring allows you to create mechanics in your worlds, such as moving platforms, double jumping etc.

Before diving into wiring and logic, we must first know 3 things. 
- **Inputs**: These are used to activate and send data to wiring. These are usually the entry point of your wiring.
- **Logic**: These are used to process inputs. These are usually the middle of your wiring.
- **Outputs**: These are used to do something in the world, using the logic's output. These are usually the endpoint of your wiring.
