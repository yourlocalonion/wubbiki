#### {tc(1670342400)}
```diff
+ added around 12 blocks
+ added an special category
+ added multiple block transform tool
+ added a new way to select brickcolors
+ if you attach the properties gui to one side of the screen, the undo and redo button and the grid size panel will go to the other side

* changed how spheres work so now they resize in a custom way
* changed a bit how blocks are displayed to allow search in the future
* made undo and redo button a bit smaller
* changed overall the size of the gui so it fits bigger screens better

- fixed a bug that somehow broke setnetworkserver and hidetextures properties
- fixed some lag issues
- fixed a bug in which blocks wouldn't load when trying to load in
```

#### {tc(1670428800)}

- fixed a bug related to the transform tool not closing correctly
- fixed resize resizing in a weird way

```diff

+ holding ctrl while clicking on an already selected part will deselect it
+ added text block

* changed how building and editing works for future compatability with wiring (a bit broken, will fix tomorrow)
* changed some variable settings so they're more precise

- resize will no longer turn a part into a thin piece of paper and move it in a weird way at the same time
- multiple selection no longer selects already selected blocks
- the transform tool no longer makes really big jumps between grabs
- move tool has been fixed so now every part follows the main part instead of its own axis
- fixed a bug in which the selection would not recognize clicks sometimes
